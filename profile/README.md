# Skin Match

Recent studies acknowledge that suitable skin care products based on individuals or groups of skin type and skin condition are needed. Here, we intend to develop an appâ€”Skin Matchâ€”which can help our users individualize their at-home skincare routine by using effective products that address their skin type. This can be achieved by making a machine learning model that classified skincare ingredients into 3-types of skin classificationâ€”namely: dry skin, oily skin, and combination skin. Skin Match simplifies the selection process, provides valuable insight for decision making, and minimizes errors in using products that are not suitable for skin type.
